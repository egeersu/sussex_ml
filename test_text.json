Surprisingly, the relatively large and powerful beer and alcohol manufacturing sector - and the huge working class that purchased their products - failed to convince any of the governments to reverse their stance on prohibition. Most provinces repealed their bans in the 1920s, though alcohol was illegal in Prince Edward Island from 1901 to 1948.

The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.", "Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada.

The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape \"Vitis vinifera\" are its \"slip-skin\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European \"vinifera\" is the characteristic \"foxy\" musk of \"V. labrusca\", best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term \"foxy\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.", "The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1754 BC (Middle Chronology).

The code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" (\"lex talionis\") as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man.\nNearly one-half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and sexual behavior.

It is located in the northern part of the province of Huesca, part of the autonomous community of Aragon in Spain. Many of its people speak the Aragonese language locally known as \"fabla\".", "Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez ( c. 1020 -- 26 June 1043 ) was ruler of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza , two small Pyrenean counties . He was the son of King Sancho III of Navarre and his wife , Mayor of Castile . Before 1035 , Sancho decreed that Gonzalo should rule Sobrarbe and Ribagorza . He succeeded to these domains after his father 's death in that year and ruled them as vassal of his brother Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III until his death . Gonzalo is thought to have been ineffectual and unpopular , with vassals defecting to his brother , Ramiro I of Aragon , during his own life , and one failing to name him in a list of rulers of Ribagorza written within a decade of his death . The Historia silense ( c. 1115 ) does not mention Gonzalo in its version of the division of Sancho III 's realm . It even records that Ramiro was given the `` remote '' region of Aragon on account of his illegitimacy , despite that Gonzalo 's division was more remote and his legitimacy unquestioned . The anonymous Chronica naierensis ( c. 1200 ) , basing its account entirely on the Silense , likewise knows nothing of Gonzalo and blames Ramiro 's position on his bastardy . An independent source , though influenced by popular legends and ballads , the Liber regum ( c. 1200 ) shows no awareness of Gonzalo . According to a document of 14 April 1035 preserved in San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a recording Sancho 's grant of Aragon to Ramiro , the castle of Loarre and monastery of San Emeterio with their dependent villages were detached from that province and given to Gonzalo . Gonzalo subsequently confirms many charters alongside his brother and they often appear together in dating clauses . With the title of king , Gonzalo appears beside all his brothers and the `` emperor '' Vermudo III of Le\u00f3n in the carta de arras of Ramiro ( 22 August 1036 ) . In 1037 Gonzalo was reunited with his brothers Garc\u00eda and Ramiro -- and the churchmen Sancho , Bishop of Pamplona ; Paterno , a Cluniac reformer ; and Abbot Blasco of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a -- to confirm a donation of Jimeno Garc\u00e9s , Ramiro 's godfather , to the monastery of Leire . In this document Garc\u00eda uses the title princeps ( prince ) to indicate his superiority , but Ramiro and Gonzalo use the title regulus ( petty king ) and are referred to as in Aragone ( ( ruling ) in Aragon ) . This meeting probably took place either in Pamplona or in Leire , but neither the day or month is preserved in the records . The use of a royal title in the presence of his elder brother Garc\u00eda is evidence that Gonzalo did not usurp it . The three brothers and Ferdinand were all at Anz\u00e1nigo ( Andizaniku ) in 1037 or perhaps 1043 , after Ferdinand had succeeded to the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n . A late source , the Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a , reports his assassination by one of his own knights , Ramonat de Uasconya ( possibly a Gascon named Ramonet ) , who threw him from the bridge over the Esera at Montcl\u00fas , near Lascorz . He was interred at San Victori\u00e1n . On his death , Garc\u00eda awarded his counties to Ramiro , which initiated several centuries of Aragonese expansionism . Gonzalo 's death on 26 June appears in the necrology of San Victori\u00e1n , but the year has been subject to much debate . Among the early modern historians , Zurita places it in 1035 and Jos\u00e9 de Moret in 1042 or 1043 . The Chronicle places it in 1037 , but there is disputed charter of September 1039 confirmed by Gonzalo . As Ramiro confirmed the rights of Bishops of Urgell in Ribagorza in September 1040 , it would appear that Gonzalo was dead by then . P\u00e9rez de Urbel thus places it between December 1039 and September 1040 and casts doubt on the dates of several documents mentioning Gonzalo after 1040 ( a donation of Blasquita from 1041 , a charter of Ramiro 's from 1042 , and a donation of Ramiro to At\u00f3n Garc\u00e9s in 1043 ) .

Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts.

The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \"worried notes\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.", "Punk rock (or simply \"punk\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \"proto-punk\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.", "Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music.

It is particularly associated with the creation of hybrid subgenres from the later 1960s including country rock and Southern rock, which have been seen as responses to the perceived excesses of dominant psychedelic and developing progressive rock. Because \"roots music\" (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. In the 1980s, roots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, new wave and heavy metal music.", "Nashville Pussy is an American rock & roll band from Atlanta, Georgia.

The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South.", "Psychobilly is a fusion genre of rock music that mixes elements of punk rock, rock and roll, rockabilly, and rhythm and blues.

Merriam-Webster defines it as \"music that blends punk rock and rockabilly\"; another dictionary defines it as \"loud frantic rockabilly music.\" About.com defines psychobilly as \"tak[ing] the traditional countrified rock style known as rockabilly, ramp[ing] up its speed to a sweaty pace, and combin[ing] it with punk rock and imagery lifted from horror films and late-night sci-fi schlock...[creating a] gritty honky tonk punk rock.\" Psychobilly, \"while rooted in the twang of rockabilly, owes just as much to the sound of straight up three-chord punk, often with a dose of thrash metal.\"\nPsychobilly is often characterized by lyrical references to science fiction, horror and exploitation films, violence, lurid sexuality, and other topics generally considered taboo, though often presented in a comedic or tongue-in-cheek fashion. Psychobilly bands and lyrics usually take an apolitical stance, a reaction to the right- and left-wing political attitudes which divided other British youth cultures. It is often played with an upright double bass, instead of the electric bass which is more common in modern rock music, and the hollowbody electric guitar, rather than the solid-bodied electric guitars that predominate in rock.

A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway.

It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.\nCocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.\nCocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the bloodbrain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the \"coca\" plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.\nAfter cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America.

Widely regarded as the country's first president to come from the indigenous population, his administration has focused on the implementation of leftist policies through authoritarian means, poverty reduction, and combating the alleged influence of the United States and multinational corporations in Bolivia. A self-declared Marxist-Leninist, Morales is the head of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party.\nBorn to an Aymara family of subsistence farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the \"campesino\" (\"rural laborers\") union, campaigning against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca as a part of the War on Drugs, which he denounced as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. He repeatedly engaged in anti-government, violent direct action protests, resulting in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.\nOnce elected in 2005, Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending, emphasising projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing neoliberalism and reducing dependence on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, his administration oversaw strong economic growth while following a policy termed \"Evonomics\" which sought to move from a liberal economic approach to a mixed economy. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with authoritarian leftist governments in the Latin American pink tide and signed Bolivia into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. Attempting to moderate the left-indigenous activist community, his administration also opposed the autonomist demands of Bolivia's eastern provinces. Winning a recall referendum in 2008, he instituted a new constitution that established Bolivia as a plurinational state and was re-elected in 2009. His second term witnessed the continuation of leftist policies and Bolivia's joining of the Bank of the South and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.

His supporters have lauded him as a champion of indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism.

Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \"consumption\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.\nTuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.\nPrevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).\nOne-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5\u00a0million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.", "Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often also associated with weight loss.\nHIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11\u00a0years.\nIn 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1.1 million deaths. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39\u00a0million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemica disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.

The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.\nThe parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. Since the introduction of screening, pregnancies with the diagnosis are often terminated. Regular screening for health problems common in Down syndrome is recommended throughout the person's life.\nThere is no cure for Down syndrome. Education and proper care have been shown to improve quality of life. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical school classes, while others require more specialized education. Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school and a few attend post-secondary education. In adulthood, about 20% in the United States do paid work in some capacity with many requiring a sheltered work environment. Support in financial and legal matters is often needed.

As an SI derived unit, it is used by most countries in the world. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (17011744), who developed a similar temperature scale. The degree Celsius (\u00b0C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. Before being renamed to honour Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called \"centigrade\", from the Latin \"centum\", which means 100, and \"gradus\", which means steps.", "The kelvin is a unit of measure for temperature based upon an absolute scale.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: \nEuropean art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \"ad libitum\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.", "A composer (Latin \"compn\"; literally \"one who puts together\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist).

The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \"color\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \"overdrive\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.", "Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width.

Banduri was born in Ragusa , Dalmatia as Matteo ( Matija ) Banduri , he joined the Benedictines at an early age and took the monk name Anselmo . He studied at Naples , and was eventually sent to Florence , then a flourishing center of higher studies . Here he made the acquaintance of the famous Benedictine scholar Bernard de Montfaucon , at the time traveling in Italy in search of manuscripts for his edition of the works of St. John Chrysostom . Banduri rendered him valuable services and in return was recommended to Cosimo III de ' Medici , Grand Duke of Tuscany for the chair of ecclesiastical history in the University of Pavia . It was also suggested that the young Benedictine be sent to Paris for a period of preparation , and especially to acquire a sound critical sense . After a short sojourn at Rome , Banduri arrived at Paris in 1702 and entered the Abbey of Saint - Germain - des - Pr\u00e9s as a pensioner of the Grand Duke of Tuscany . He soon became an apt disciple of the French Maurists and began an edition of the anti-iconoclastic writings of Nicephorus of Constantinople , of the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia , and of other Greek ecclesiastical authors . Banduri never published these works , though as late as 1722 he announced , as near at hand , their appearance in four folio volumes . In the meantime , he was attracted by the rich treasures of Byzantine manuscript and other material in the Biblioth\u00e8que Royale and the Biblioth\u00e8que Colbert .

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\"mousike\"; \"art of the Muses\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no noise, only sound.\"", "A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded).

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\"mousike\"; \"art of the Muses\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no noise, only sound.\"", "Art punk involves punk bands who are more sophisticated than their peers and go beyond the genre's garage rock foundations.

The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\"constitutional\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\"absolute\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\"mousike\"; \"art of the Muses\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to.

In this reckoning Central Semitic itself is one of three divisions of Semitic along with East Semitic ( Akkadian ) and South Semitic ( South Arabian , and the Semitic languages of Ethiopia ) . Distinctive features of Central Semitic languages include the following : The realization of the common Semitic emphatic consonants as pharyngealized rather than ejectives : E.g. Proto - Semitic *  ( t ) and *  ( ts ) are realized as ( t ) and ( s ) in Arabic and Neo-Aramaic , in contrast to remaining ejectives in South Arabian and in Ethiopian Semitic . Additionally , Proto - Semitic *  ( k ) becomes a uvular stop ( q ) . An innovative negation marker * bal , of uncertain origin . The generalization of t as the suffix conjugation past tense marker , levelling an earlier alternation between * k in the first person and * t in the second person . A new prefix conjugation for the non-past tense , of the form ya - qtulu , replacing the inherited ya - qattal form ( these are schematic verbal forms , as if derived from an example triconsonantal root q - t - l ) . Levelling of vowels in verb prefixes . The evidence of Akkadian suggests four Proto - Semitic prefixes : * a - , * ta - , * ni - , * yi - . In Central Semitic , all prefixes have the same vowel within a given verb paradigm . This however developed slightly differently in the different languages : Arabic has generalized a in all prefixes , while Northwest Semitic has generalized either a or i , depending on the verb stem in question . Different classification systems disagree on the precise structure of the group . The most common approach divides it into Arabic and Northwest Semitic , while SIL Ethnologue has South Central Semitic ( including Arabic and Hebrew ) vs. Aramaic . The main distinction between Arabic and the Northwest Semitic languages is the presence of broken plurals in the former . The majority of Arabic masculine non-human nouns form plurals in this manner ( called inanimate plural ) , whereas almost all nouns in the Northwest Semitic languages form their plurals with a suffix .

The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period.

The inhalation form presents with fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath. The intestinal form presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection.\nAnthrax is spread by contact with the spores of the bacteria, which are often from infectious animal products. Contact is by breathing, eating, or through an area of broken skin. It does not typically spread directly between people. Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products, travelers, postal workers, and military personnel. Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site.\nAnthrax vaccination is recommended for people who are at high risk. Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. Two months of antibiotics, such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin, after exposure can also prevent infection. If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin. The type and number of antibiotics used depends on the type of infection. Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection.\nAnthrax among humans is most common in Africa and central and Southern Asia. It also occurs fairly regularly in Southern Europe, but is uncommon in Northern Europe and North America. Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year, with about two cases a year in the United States. Skin infections represent more than 95% of cases.

This trait has, throughout history, linked LAB with food fermentations, as acidification inhibits the growth of spoilage agents. Proteinaceous bacteriocins are produced by several LAB strains and provide an additional hurdle for spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, lactic acid and other metabolic products contribute to the organoleptic and textural profile of a food item. The industrial importance of the LAB is further evidenced by their generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, due to their ubiquitous appearance in food and their contribution to the healthy microflora of human mucosal surfaces.

Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling. The swelling may feel fluid filled when pressed. The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling. Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles with carbuncles being larger.\nThey are usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is \"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\". Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.\nStandard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage. There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics for this type of abscess in most people who are otherwise healthy. A small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with gauze after drainage. Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning. Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient.\nSkin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as 65% in this population. In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess.

Through cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to metabolise substances, like sugars or fats, to obtain energy. In this type of respiration, oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport chain. Aerobic respiration has the advantage of yielding more energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) than fermentation or anaerobic respiration, but obligate aerobes are subject to high levels of oxidative stress.", "Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response, is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point. There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between . The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contraction and causes a feeling of cold. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat. Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure. This is more common in young children. Fevers do not typically go higher than .\nA fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from the not serious to potentially serious. This includes viral, bacterial and parasitic infections such as the common cold, urinary tract infections, meningitis, malaria and appendicitis among others. Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, side effects of medication, and cancer among others. It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set-point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.\nTreatment to reduce fever is generally not required. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest. Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol may help with this as well as lower temperature. Measures such as putting a cool damp cloth on the forehead and having a slightly warm bath are not useful and may simply make a person more uncomfortable. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. Hyperthermia does require treatment.\nFever is one of the most common medical signs. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.

A few, however, such as \"Megasphaera\", \"Pectinatus\", \"Selenomonas\" and \"Zymophilus\", have a porous pseudo-outer membrane that causes them to stain Gram-negative. Scientists once classified the Firmicutes to include all Gram-positive bacteria, but have recently defined them to be of a core group of related forms called the low-G+C group, in contrast to the Actinobacteria.

The name \"endospore\" is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (\"endo\" means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in gram-positive bacteria. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. Revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. When the environment becomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state.
